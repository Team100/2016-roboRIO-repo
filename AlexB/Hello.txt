Hi. Welcome to my folder.

Here are all of the projects that I have worked on. I recommend that you check them out.

I have a Python NetworkTable Speed Tester.
	You can check out my documentation in FRCNetworkTables/Info.html
	It is designed for two computers (Mac, Win, Linux) using a Roborio as an intermediary stage.

TestShuffleboardPlugin doesn't work currently. Look at Laura's

PWMTest tests the NavX as a PWM

DataMonitor is a copy of the official NavX project that prints all useful data to SmartDashboard.

Enjoy!
